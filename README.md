## Face-Learning A.I.
Ever had a 1st date where the 2 of you just hit it off? Where you both just had a blast? Ya they were good-looking, but it was their cool personality that made the date awesome! Want more awesome first dates like that? We're optimizing Watson AI to make it happen on the regular!

## We're Pandora's Adaptive Song Suggestion Engine, but for Faces
Tired of browsing through endless profiles? Using face recognition, Excited’s A.I. can learn faces. Each time you like a face, it teaches our A.I. who you're attracted to, for a more personalized browsing experience, suited to your physical tastes.

## Say goodbye to #FalseAdvertising
Ever meet someone who looks way different than their profile pic? Watson’s A.I. automatically prevents this! Besides, we believe you're good-looking just the way you are, and that honesty in your digital portrayal will help people be genuinely attracted to you!

## Your Truest Personality
Our A.I. automatically and continuously learns your truest personality across 30+ traits, attitudes, & characteristics, so you never have to fill out never-ending questionnaires, or spend hours describing yourself. The result? More accurate matching!

## When Opposites Attract
Adjust sensitivity on certain personality scores to ensure we're helping you find people you'd like. For example, just because you're adventurous, doesn't mean you want to date others who are also adventurous. Be in control, or let our A.I. figure it out for you!

## We take the creepy, out of dating!
Ever meet up with a hot guy or gal you met online, only to find out they’re kind of creepy in person? Excited’s A.I. visually compares and overlays your truest personality with theirs, before you decide to meet up! Oh and did we mention you can video chat with them first?
